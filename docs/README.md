# Intercross

## Introduction

Intercross is an open-source Android app designed to enhance the management of plant breeding crosses. It supports crossing activities by importing cross wishlists, tracking parental and cross IDs along with progress toward goals as crosses are made, and capturing metadata such as the number of flowers, fruits, and seeds. The app facilitates physical tracking of crossing material by printing custom labels to Zebra mobile printers and enables data transfer by exporting completed cross lists as files.

Developed as part of the PhenoApps initiative, Intercross complements a broader suite of tools that leverage mobile technology to modernize data collection and organization in plant breeding. The source code is available on GitHub.
