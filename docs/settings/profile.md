## Person

The "Person" setting defines the name of the individual creating crosses. This information is saved with each cross record and included in exports.

### Setting Your Name

1. Navigate to Settings > Profile
2. Tap "Person"
3. Enter your name or identifier
4. Press "OK"

This name will appear in the crossing history and all exports, making it possible to track who created each cross.

## Experiment

The "Experiment" setting defines the name of the current breeding experiment or project.

### Setting Experiment Name

1. Navigate to Settings > Profile
2. Tap "Experiment"
3. Enter your experiment name
4. Press "OK"

The experiment name is included in exports and can be used to categorize or filter crosses from different projects.

## Multiple Users

If multiple people use the same device:

1. Consider creating separate experiment names for each person
2. Always update the Person name before beginning work
3. Use the export feature to save data before switching users

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions for Person and Experiment
- Update the Experiment name when beginning a new project
- For shared devices, verify the correct profile is active before making crosses
